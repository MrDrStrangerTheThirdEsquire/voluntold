# voluntold
Voluntold is a program that allows teachers to automatically pick a student in a class and have everyone go through the list before someone else can be selected again.  Normal random generators will keep picking the same students over and over and this program solves that issue.  It is customizable and simple to use.

## Usage
This program is free to use under the MIT License, so feel free to use it however you would like.  
Right now, the project is designed to be used with multiple teachers in mind.  If this is not your case and you wish to use it for your own use, the `template.html`, `template.js`, and `template.json` files will be for you.

## Want your own version?
Check out our [template repository](https://github.com/sheepman39/voluntold-template) and follow the instructions there to make your own version to use in class.
If there are any problems with it, feel free to [submit an issue here](https://github.com/sheepman39/voluntold/issues) and I will do my best to help you out.
